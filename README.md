## Smart Contracts
Smart Contracts are programs that live on the blockchain. These programs are executed when certain conditions are met. Smart Contracts eliminate the need for any intermediary's involvement and are sufficient to carry out an agreement between two parties. When the correct conditions are met, the contract is executed. git

## Why are they beneficial?

These Smart Contracts are beneficial because they are automated. Transactions, contracts, or any agreement between two parties can take place all in the blockchain. This process is fast, efficient, and accurate and it eliminates the need for paperwork. Smart contracts are also secure and transparent. Because all contracts live in the blockchain, these contracts are encrypted and secure. The records are also logged in the blockchain, so its also transparent. The beauty of smart contracts is that it cuts the need for a middleman. Parties dont need intermideary intervention, they dont need to pay extra fees, its all works directly on blockchain.
