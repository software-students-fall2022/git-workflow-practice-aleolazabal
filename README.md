## Smart Contracts
Smart Contracts are programs that live on the blockchain. These programs are executed when certain conditions are met. Smart Contracts eliminate the need for any intermediary's involvement and are sufficient to carry out an agreement between two parties. When the correct conditions are met, the contract is executed. git

## Why are they beneficial?

These Smart Contracts are beneficial because they are automated. Transactions, contracts, or any agreement between two parties can take place all in the blockchain. This process is fast, efficient, and accurate and it eliminates the need for paperwork. Smart contracts are also secure and transparent. Because all contracts live in the blockchain, these contracts are encrypted and secure. The records are also logged in the blockchain, so its also transparent. The beauty of smart contracts is that it cuts the need for a middleman. Parties dont need intermideary intervention, they dont need to pay extra fees, its all works directly on blockchain. 


### Charlie Xiang's Add-On

I found this really interesting! Blockchain is of course quite revolutionary, but it has a major flaw in my personal opinion, which is that it is hard for people who don't have a foundational understanding of CS concepts to truly understand it. I would venture to say that most people who talk about blockchain don't really understand what it is, or how it works -- which makes sense, because there's a level of technical understanding that that requires, which the average person probably doesn't have. Also, a smart contract may cut out the middleman, but it cannot reduce the time necessary to complete a transaction. From my understanding, blockchain transactions are quite slow by nature, and so a smart contract can only do so much.
